# avocode

An [AVO](avo-paper.md)-inspired agent harness. AVO replaces classical evolutionary variation
operators with an autonomous coding agent — `Vary(P_t) = Agent(P_t, K, f)`. `avocode` extracts that
harness and makes it general and agent-agnostic.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the architecture, the slice order, and the invariants.

## Status

S0 (skeleton + health check) and S1 (`f` — scoring) are done. `avo doctor` and `avo score` work.

## Quickstart

```sh
npm install
just check          # lint + typecheck + test
./bin/avo doctor    # dependency and API-key status

cd /your/repo
avo score --init hyperfine   # scaffold .avo/score (or: pytest, vitest)
avo score                    # run it
avo score --json | jq .      # the normalized attempt an agent reads
```

## `avo score` — the `f` contract

`f` is the only thing that tells the agent whether a variation was an improvement, so its contract
is frozen: `.avo/score` is any executable printing one JSON line, and it always exits 0 — a build
error or a failed test is a *result*, and the agent can only act on it as data. See
[templates/score/README.md](templates/score/README.md) for the full authoring guide and
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) §3 for the contract itself.

`avo score` validates that line, names the offending field when it is wrong, normalizes it into an
**attempt** (`primary` flipped so higher is always better; `null` when the candidate fails), and
appends it to `.avo/attempts.jsonl`. Attempts are not commits — that gate is `avo commit` (S2).

| Flag | |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | the normalized attempt as one line |
| `--parallel` | fan configs out concurrently, if the scorer implements `--configs` |
| `--timeout <s>` | kill the scorer — and its children — after s seconds |
| `--init <t>` | scaffold `.avo/score` from a template; idempotent, never clobbers an edit |
| `--no-record` | skip the attempt log |
| `--cwd <dir>` | treat dir as the repo root |

Exit codes: `0` pass, `1` ran but failed, `2` harness error (no scorer, malformed output, timeout).

## `avo doctor`

`avo doctor` exits 1 when a required dependency (`git`, `jq`) is missing, or when no coding agent
(`pi`, `claude`, `codex`) is on `PATH` — one is required to act as the variation operator. Optional
dependencies (`qmd`, `bd`, `hyperfine`, `just`) are reported but never fail the check; each slice
that needs one degrades with a named fallback. API keys are reported as present/unset only — their
values never appear in any output.

## Tasks

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just check` | lint + typecheck + test — the health check every Ralph cycle runs first |
| `just e2e` | exercises the real `bin/avo`; writes `evidence/s{0,1}-e2e.txt` |
| `just all` | `check` + `e2e` |
| `just doctor` | `./bin/avo doctor` |

## Layout

```
bin/avo           entrypoint; runs src/main.ts through tsx (no build step)
src/cli.ts        subcommand dispatcher
src/doctor.ts     dependency + API-key report
src/score.ts      f — run, validate and normalize .avo/score
src/io.ts         injectable output sink, so commands are unit-testable
templates/score/  reference scorers + the authoring guide
test/             node:test unit tests + e2e.sh, e2e-score.sh
evidence/         artifacts proving user-facing behavior works end to end
```

`ralph.sh` is the meta loop that builds this repo; it is not part of `avo` itself.
